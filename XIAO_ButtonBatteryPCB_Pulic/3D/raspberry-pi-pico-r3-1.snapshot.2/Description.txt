Raspberry Pi Pico-R3

The first micro controller offered from the Raspberry Pi foundation. 

The software support and documentation are solid.  I will try to use it in a few projects.

It's nice that it is programmable in both MicroPython and C++.
MicroPython files can be dragged and dropped to work right away, but I'm not sure if the same can be done for C/C++ files.

I was hoping for better deep sleep currents and idle power usage and also WiFi like the ESP32. Also a USB Type C connector in 2021 would have been nice.

I hope they take inspiration from the Tiny Pico (low power usage ESP32) and its good low power features.
